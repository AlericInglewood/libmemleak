Quick start
===========

./configure [--prefix=/usr]
make
su
make install

If you obtained the source code from git, then first
run './autogen.sh' (requires cwautomacros to be installed).
In this case you might want to configure with
--enable-maintainer-mode; then ./autogen.sh needs to be
rerun after running 'make maintainer-clean'.

If that doesn't work, mail me: carlo@alinoe.com
(include as many details as possible).

See README.md for usage documentation of this library.
Or https://github.com/CarloWood/libmemleak for the
html version there of.
